# AI Driven Entity Resolution with the ACM DBLP2 Dataset

This repository contains the data, scripts and tutorials required to learn how to use AI entity resolution / record matching using the ACM DBLP2 publication record dataset.

There are two segments to the tutorial, one which uses supervised training to discover a [classifier](https://vectorlink.ai/blog/leveraging-llms-and-machine-learning-for-record-matching/) for LLM generated embeddings of csv data and the other which uses [LLM classifier bootstrapping](https://vectorlink.ai/blog/llm-classifier-bootstrapping/) to drive classifier generation in a completely automated, unsupervised way.

If you have any trouble with the tutorials, please leave an issue.
