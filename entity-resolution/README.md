# AI Driven Entity Resolution with the ACM DBLP2 Dataset

This repository contains the data, scripts and tutorials required to learn how to use AI entity resolution / record matching using the ACM DBLP2 publication record dataset.

There are two segments to the tutorial, one which uses supervised training to discover a [classifier](./RecordMatch.md) for LLM generated embeddings of csv data and the other which uses [LLM classifier bootstrapping](./LLMClassifierBootstrapping.md) to drive classifier generation in a completely automated, unsupervised way.

If you have any trouble with the tutorials, please leave an issue.
